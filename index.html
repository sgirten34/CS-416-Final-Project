    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Electric cars have been a growing segment of auto manufacturing and provide 
      an alternative option that can dramatically increase the fuel efficiency versus 
      traditional gasoline or diesel engines. Production of electric vehicles has increased
      over the past several years, but overall electric vehicles still represent a small proportion
      of all vehicles on the road.  To better understand the market share and fuel efficiency of 
      electric vehicles, an exploration was conducted on a dataset of vehicles from 2017.
       This presentation contains a sample of 146 vehicles from 2017 and initally explores the
        distributions of the fuel type and number of cylinders from this sample.  The presentation
         concludes by demonstrating the dramatic improvement in fuel efficiency from electric 
         vehicles over gas and diesel engines.
